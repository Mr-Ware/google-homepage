This is my attempt at the first project for The Odin Project: recreate the Google homepage.

Step 0: Utilize chrome developer tool to look at the structure of the google homepage and see where I might begin. I noticed that there were several rows of containers (5), many of which had their own sub-containers with their own content. 

Realizing that this must be some kind of flexbox/flexgrid, I watched several crash course videos on the subject, playing around with wit in VSC until I had a better grasp of it. 

Step 1: After a good nights sleep and a chance to let the diffuse learning mode do it's thing, I'm back on VSC to create the top nav bar for my google homepage.
